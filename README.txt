Reflection.

status: alpha 1

A 2D game about reflecting lasers to kill enemies. Being written in Python w/ Pygame.



TO START THE GAME PROPERLY:
 - Put all the crap that's in the repo in a folder called "whatever"
 - make a start.py file in "whatever"'s parent directory:
	http://pastebin.com/pu9grEvg
 - run start.py to start the game!



A few notes to better understand the code:

 - classes, variables etc with a leading undersocre _ should be thought of as 'private'. E.g, they should not be assigned to or called.

 - all variables have a trailing underscore _ (except private ones or arguments)

 - The actual ray reflection code has been improved and is now pretty!

 - The more I code the less shits I give about the previously mentioned naming convention.. Oh well have fun.
