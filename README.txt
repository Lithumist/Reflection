Reflection.

status: pre-alpha

A 2D game about reflecting lasers to kill enemies. Being written in Python w/ Pygame.


A few notes to better understand the code:

 - classes, variables etc with a leading undersocre _ should be thought of as 'private'. E.g, they should not be assigned to or called.

 - all variables have a trailing underscore _ (except private ones or arguments)

 - The actual ray reflection code is god-forsaken mess i'm so sorry (Working on making it better!)

 - The more I code the less shits I give about the previously mentioned naming convention.. Oh well have fun.
